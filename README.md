# k-factor

Script to generate a test g-code for k-factor calibration in Marlin LIN_ADVANCE

The code should be self explanatory if you know what LIN_ADVANCE is.

This script was inspired by https://mattshub.com/2017/10/02/linear-advance/ (look for the script by Sebastianv650)

ATTENTION: We decided to merge the BASH and JS scripts in the same repo, and the now home for them is now:

Please send contributions there instead.

Thank you!
